# BeatSaber-Playlists
let's spit-swap some song tastes

## Usage

BeatSaber playlists let you group songs into a collection. By using this repo, we can effectively share our playlists together.

## Assumptions

It is assumed that you have:
- Copies of the songs being referenced by these playlists
    - If you don't, contact me to figure it out. :-)
- [BeatSaberPlaylistsLib](https://github.com/Zingabopp/BeatSaberPlaylistsLib)
    - Can easily be downloaded via [ModAssistant](https://github.com/Assistant/ModAssistant)

## Instructions

1. Open your BeatSaber root folder.
    - If using a Steam copy of the game, right-clicking BeatSaber in your game library -> Properties -> Browse
1. Run the following in the root folder: `git clone https://github.com/Chris-Perkins/BeatSaber-Playlists.git Playlists`
   - If you have a folder there already, then you'll need to manually merge the git folder and the original.
1. Donezo. Playlists can be found when browsing your songs in Solo mode.
